    <h1>The June 2025 Google Core Update: What Beginners Should Watch For</h1>
    <p class="read-time">🕒 5 min read</p>

    <p>If you're learning SEO in 2025, you're entering at an exciting time — Google just rolled out its latest Core Algorithm Update in June, and it's already having a big impact on search rankings. In this blog, we'll break down what the update changed, what SEO experts are saying, and what small sites and beginners should focus on going forward.</p>

    <h2>What Changed in the June 2025 Update?</h2>
    <p>Google's June core update emphasized content quality and site authority even more. Pages that had thin content, outdated info, or overly SEO-optimized formatting saw drops in traffic. Google appears to be better at identifying helpful, human-centered writing — even if it's from smaller domains.</p>

    <h2>How to Know if You Were Affected</h2>
    <p>You can track changes using Google Search Console or tools like GA4. If your impressions or clicks suddenly dropped after June 5–10, you might've been impacted. Most sites noticed changes in traffic between June 7 and June 13.</p>

    <h2>What Experts Are Saying</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>"We're seeing stronger preference for websites that genuinely serve a user's intent."</li>
      <li>"Old tricks like keyword stuffing or link-swapping aren't cutting it anymore."</li>
      <li>"Smaller blogs with high-quality guides actually outperformed big names in a few categories."</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Beginner Tips to Adapt Now</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Refresh Your Old Content:</strong> Google wants updated, relevant pages. Don't leave your articles untouched for a year.</li>
      <li><strong>Focus on Fewer, Better Pages:</strong> It's better to have 10 strong guides than 50 shallow ones.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Clear Language:</strong> Avoid robotic phrasing. Write like you'd explain something to a friend.</li>
      <li><strong>Add Internal Links:</strong> Help users (and Google) navigate your site more easily.</li>
      <li><strong>Watch Performance Metrics:</strong> In GA4, track average engagement time, bounce rate, and user retention over time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What This Means for the Future</h2>
    <p>If you're building your SEO skills today, focus less on shortcuts and more on helpful, organized content. Google is rewarding real effort — so keep learning, keep writing, and don't panic after every update.</p>
