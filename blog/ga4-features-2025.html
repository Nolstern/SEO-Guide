    <h1>3 New GA4 Features You Should Actually Be Using (Summer 2025)</h1>
    <p class="read-time">🕒 4 min read</p>

    <p>Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is evolving fast — and if you're learning SEO or content strategy in 2025, you can't afford to ignore it. This post covers three new GA4 features that actually make tracking useful and accessible for small sites and beginners.</p>

    <h2>1. Custom Channel Groups (Now with AI Suggestions)</h2>
    <p>GA4 now lets you define your own traffic channels — and even suggests groupings based on your site's performance. Instead of relying on generic categories like "organic search" or "social," you can track traffic in a way that reflects your real content goals.</p>
    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This gives you better clarity on what's actually working — especially if you promote across newsletters, YouTube, or niche forums.</p>

    <h2>2. Improved Path Exploration for UX Insights</h2>
    <p>Path Exploration lets you see how users move through your site — but the 2025 update makes it cleaner and faster. You can now build visual flowcharts that show where users drop off or convert, without needing a degree in analytics.</p>
    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> It helps small site owners quickly understand where readers are getting lost (or sticking around).</p>

    <h2>3. AI-Powered Anomaly Detection</h2>
    <p>GA4 now includes lightweight anomaly detection — flagging days when traffic, conversions, or bounce rate change significantly without needing to check every report.</p>
    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Beginners often miss red flags. Now, GA4 nudges you when something looks off, even if you only check it once a week.</p>

    <h2>Final Thought</h2>
    <p>If you've been putting off learning GA4, now's the time. These features make it easier to track what matters — and actually use your data to grow. You don't have to be a data nerd to see real results.</p>
