    <h1>Putting Your SEO Skills to Work</h1>
    <p>You have learned the basics. Now it is time to put them into action. This section will guide you through building your first SEO project from scratch. You do not need coding experience. I used Cursor, an AI-powered code editor, to build my site, and it helped me organize everything from layout to SEO tags. I will show you how to do something similar, no matter what platform or method you choose. The goal is to create something real that people can find, trust, and explore.</p>

    <h3>Step-by-Step: Your First SEO Project</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Pick Your Platform or Coding Method</strong><br>
        There are many ways to build a website. If you prefer using a website builder, WordPress is beginner-friendly and offers many plugins for SEO. If you want more control and want to understand how websites work, GitHub Pages is a great free option for hosting your own code. I used a tool called Cursor, which combines code editing with helpful AI suggestions. It helped me set up my HTML, add SEO tags, and improve my page structure without needing to write perfect code. You can follow that approach and let Cursor guide you as you learn.

        <strong>Plan Your First Page</strong><br>
        Start small. Choose a topic you care about that people are also searching for. It could be a one-page guide, a blog post, or a simple tutorial. Focus on being helpful and clear. You do not need to be perfect. The goal is to create something useful and real.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Do Keyword Research</strong><br>
        Use free tools like Google Search, Ubersuggest, or AnswerThePublic to find long-tail keywords related to your topic. If your page is about plant care, a useful keyword might be how to take care of a snake plant. Choose keywords that match your topic and reflect what people are actually searching for. If you need a refresher, visit the Keyword Basics page.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Build and Structure Your Page</strong><br>
        Use your main keyword in the title, headings, and meta description. Add alt text to images. Make sure your page loads quickly and works well on phones. Use clear sections with subheadings and link to other helpful pages on your site. For example, if you also wrote about image optimization or title tags, link to those pages so readers and search engines can find them. This is also how internal linking helps improve your overall SEO.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Track What Is Working</strong><br>
        Use Google Search Console to see if your page is being found. You can also use Google Analytics to track how visitors are engaging with your site. Look for data like keyword clicks, bounce rate, and time on page. These metrics show what is working and what can be improved. If you are new to these tools, check out our Beginner's Guide to Google Analytics.

    </ol>

    <h3>Keep Moving Forward</h3>
    <p>You do not need to be an expert to start. Every SEO professional was once a beginner. Keep things simple, stay consistent, and learn as you go. Revisit earlier guides like Keyword Basics or Writing Better Titles whenever you need a refresher. The more you practice, the more confident you will become. Building something real is the best way to grow.</p>
